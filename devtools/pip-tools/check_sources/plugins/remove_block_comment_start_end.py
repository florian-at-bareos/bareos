"""
 this plugin compresses /* and */ alone in one line for block comments so that
 they are merged into the second and the last line, respecrively.

 It compresses comments like

 /*
  * this is a block
  * comment
  */

to:

 /* this is a block
  * comment */


Comments that start in column one (file license info, function documentation)
should remain untouched
